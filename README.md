****ü§ñ M.A.L. (Model Asset Loader)****

**Tired of manually downloading .safetensors? So was I.**

M.A.L. is a desktop application I'm building to streamline the entire lifecycle of your AI assets. It connects to popular sources like Hugging Face, lets you search for models, and downloads them directly into the correct, pre-configured folders for your favorite UI.

This project is under active development. I'm building this in the open and shipping features weekly!
üöÄ Key Features

    Universal Search: Find models and resources from Hugging Face (with more sources coming soon!) from a single, clean interface.

    Intelligent Downloads: Download files directly to the right location. M.A.L. knows the default folder structures for ComfyUI, A1111, Forge, and more.

    Fully Configurable: Don't like the defaults? Point M.A.L. to any base folder and define your own custom paths for every model type.

    Detailed Views: See a model's full README and browse all its files before you commit to downloading.

    Real-Time Download Manager: A sleek, non-intrusive toast notification system keeps you updated on download progress without interrupting your workflow.

    Secure & Robust: Built with a security-first mindset. Downloads are atomic (no corrupted files) and path resolution is locked to your base directory.

**üî≠ The Vision: My Roadmap**

M.A.L. is more than just a downloader. My goal is for it to be the central hub for your entire local AI ecosystem. Here's where I'm headed:

Phase 1: Polish the Core (Now Underway)

    [x] Re-implement advanced search sorting and filtering.

    [ ] Complete a full UI/CSS cleanup for a polished, professional feel.

    [ ] Implement a Local Library Manager to view, manage, and delete files you've already downloaded.

Phase 2: Environment Management

    [ ] Add functionality to download and manage the AI UIs themselves (ComfyUI, A1111, etc.).

    [ ] Integrate more model sources, with CivitAI as the next major target.

Phase 3: The Platform

    [ ] Expand support to a wider range of applications, including LLM chat interfaces.

    [ ] Create comprehensive documentation on a dedicated website.

**üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack**

M.A.L. is built with a modern, fast, and reliable stack, running as a local web application.

    Backend: Python with FastAPI for a high-performance, asynchronous API.

    Frontend: React & TypeScript for a robust, type-safe, and interactive user experience.
