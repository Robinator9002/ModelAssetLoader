**Tired of manually downloading `.safetensors`? So was I.**

M.A.L. is a desktop application built to streamline the entire lifecycle of your AI assets. It connects to popular sources like **[Hugging Face]**, lets you search for models, and downloads them directly into the correct, pre-configured folders for your favorite UI.

With a robust backend and a polished, reactive frontend, M.A.L. has moved beyond its initial development phase and is now focused on refinement and feature expansion.

### üöÄ Key Features

-   **[Universal Search]**: Find models and resources from Hugging Face (with more sources coming soon!) from a single, clean interface.
-   **[Intelligent Downloads]**: Download files directly to the right location. M.A.L. knows the default folder structures for ComfyUI, A1111, Forge, and more.
-   **[Fully Configurable]**: Don't like the defaults? Point M.A.L. to any base folder and define your own custom paths for every model type.
-   **[Detailed Views]**: See a model's full README and browse all its files before you commit to downloading.
-   **[Real-Time Download Manager]**: A sleek sidebar keeps you updated on download, installation, and process progress without interrupting your workflow.
-   **[Environment Management]**: Install, manage, run, and even "adopt" existing installations of AI UIs like ComfyUI and A1111 directly within the app.
-   **[Secure & Robust]**: Built with a security-first mindset. Downloads are atomic (no corrupted files) and path resolution is locked to your base directory.

### üî≠ The Vision: Project Roadmap

M.A.L. is more than just a downloader. The goal is for it to be the central hub for your entire local AI ecosystem. Here's where we're at:

#### ‚úÖ **Phase 1: Polish the Core** `(Finished)`

-   [x] Re-implement advanced search sorting and filtering.
-   [x] Complete a full UI/CSS cleanup for a polished, professional feel.
-   [x] Add a Download Sidebar for better visibility and workflow.

#### ‚úÖ **Phase 2: Environment Management** `(Finished)`

-   [x] Implement a Local Library Manager to view, manage, and delete files.
-   [x] Add functionality to download and manage the AI UIs themselves.
-   [x] Rework Configuration and Installation Mechanics for the Automation System.
-   [x] Add Adoption Mechanic for existing installations.
-   [x] Implement robust cancellation for UI downloads and fix process start functionality.

#### ‚è≥ **Phase 3: Architectural Rework** `(Close to Finish)`

-   [x] Decomposed UI Management into specialized services (Process, Installation).
-   [x] Decomposed File Management into specialized services (Filesystem, Downloader).
-   [x] Refactored all API endpoints into domain-specific routers.
-   [x] Established a dedicated, reusable API service layer on the frontend.
