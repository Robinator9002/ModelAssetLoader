The Problem

Tired of manually downloading .safetensors into stable-diffusion-webui/models/Lora/? Can't remember which models/checkpoints folder belongs to ComfyUI versus Forge? Spending more time organizing files than generating images?

We've been there. So we fixed it.
The Solution

M.A.L. (Model Asset Loader) is a powerful desktop application built to streamline the entire lifecycle of your AI assets. It serves as a central command center, connecting to popular sources like Hugging Face and downloading models directly into the correct, pre-configured folders for your favorite UI.

This project is under active and continuous development. We're building this in the open and shipping features weekly.

üî≠ The Vision: Our Roadmap

M.A.L. aims to be the essential hub for your entire local AI ecosystem. This is where we're headed:

    Phase 1: Polish the Core (Now Underway)

        [x] Re-implement advanced search sorting and filtering.

        [ ] Complete a full UI/CSS cleanup for a polished, professional feel.

        [ ] Implement a Local Library Manager to view, manage, and delete files you've already downloaded.

    Phase 2: Environment Management

        [ ] Add functionality to download and manage the AI UIs themselves (ComfyUI, A1111, etc.).

        [ ] Integrate more model sources, with CivitAI as the next major target.

    Phase 3: The Platform

        [ ] Expand support to a wider range of applications, including LLM chat interfaces.

        [ ] Create comprehensive documentation on a dedicated website.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

M.A.L. is built with a modern, fast, and reliable stack, running as a local client-server application to ensure maximum performance and responsiveness.

    Backend: A powerful and asynchronous API built with Python and FastAPI.
